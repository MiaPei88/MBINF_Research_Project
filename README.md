Project Title: EXPLORING EVOLUTION OF REPETITIVE ELEMENTS IN RELATION TO THE ECOLOGY OF EGGPLANT SPECIES

This repository includes all the related files for my research project for MBINF (Master of Bioinformatics) program at the University of Guelph

The raw data is not open to the public, but my code files in "ComputeCan" subdirectory are the pipeline for generating repeat profiles, which were run by the number in the title in order from 1 to 9. 

1_AddingColumns_CombineAll.py and 2_Analysing_RE2_output.R should be run using the final repeat annotations files in the "RE2_manual_annotaion" subdirectory. Detailed information about running these two files are inside the files themselves

Figures in "R_Plots" subdirectory are the output figures from 2_Analysing_RE2_output.R
